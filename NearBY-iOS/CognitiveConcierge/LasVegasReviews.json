         "Crazy expensive, but the food was wonderful. Endless amount of courses. Great dining experience and would recommend to go again.",
         "Classy restaurant that definitely has the price tag. Setting was too posh for me, but I guess some people prefer the high class, fancy schmancy appeal. If you like giving away everything inside your wallet for food, this is the place for you!"
